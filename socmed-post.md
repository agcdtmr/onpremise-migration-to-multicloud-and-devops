#TechProject Tuesday! 🚀

Last year marked a significant milestone as I transitioned into my first tech role. Since then, the journey has been filled with consistent learning and growth.

Reflecting on my journey, I realized one mistake I made at the beginning was not publicly sharing my progress and achievements. Today, I'm rectifying that and couldn't be more nervous and excited!

I'm thrilled to present my latest progress—successful migration of an on-premise applications to a multi-cloud environment! 🌐 Where I explored modern technologies like AWS, Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

For those who know me well professionally, you're aware of my enjoyment for writing documentation, so I've taken this opportunity to publish it as my first blog article - "Unlocking the Basics: A Beginner's Project of On-Premise Migration to MultiCloud with AWS, Google Cloud, and DevOps Tools – Docker, K8s, Terraform," a detailed step-by-step guide tailored for beginners.
